# Week 5 notes of HarvardX's Introduction to Computer Science course

Topic: Data Structures 

## Data Structures 

* **Data structures** are more complex ways to organize data in memory, allowing us to store information in different layouts. 
* Tools to building data structures: 
  * `struct` to create custom data types
  * `.` to access properties in a structure
  * `*` to go to an address in memory pointed to by a pointer
  * `->` to access properties in a structure pointed to by a pointer

## Linked Lists

* With a **linked list**, we can store a list of values that can easily be grown by storing values in different parts of memory.
